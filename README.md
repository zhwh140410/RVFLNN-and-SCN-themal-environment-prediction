# RVFLNN-and-SCN-themal-environment-prediction
   With the improvement of China's metro carrying capacity, people in big cities are inclined to travel by metro. 
The carrying load of these metros is huge during the morning and evening rush hour. Coupled with the increase of summer tourists, 
the thermal environmental quality in early metro stations will decline badly.
Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the factors that affect the thermal environment in the metro station and establish a thermal environment change model. 
This will help to support the prediction and analysis of the thermal environment in such limited underground spaces. 
In order to achieve a relatively accurate and rapid on-line modeling, this paper proposes a thermal environment modeling method based on Random Vector Functional Link Neural Network (RVFLNN). 
This modeling method has the advantages of fast modeling speed and relatively accurate prediction results.
Once the preprocessed data is input into this RVFLNN for training, the metro station thermal environment model will be quickly established. 
The study results show that the thermal model based on the RVFLNN method can effectively predict the temperature inside the metro station.
